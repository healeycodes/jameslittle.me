# Wishlist

This feels kind of weird to write out, but I wanted to have something up so that if someone wanted to get me a gift they'd have some idea of what to get.

- A stylish floor lamp
- Some sort of coffee table book about design or architecture or San Francisco or something
- A gift card for [Green Apple Books](https://www.greenapplebooks.com)
- In a similar vein, a cookbook so we can get better at making dinner!
- Smart-home stuff! I've been using [LifX lightbulbs](https://www.lifx.com/pages/lightbulbs), which are good. I'm also in the market for a smart switch or some IP cameras or some [smart plugs](https://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7C063/). My only guideline is that they work with Homekit or Homebridge -- maybe check with me first if you're not sure.
- A candle snuffer
- [This book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/software-design-flexibility) that doesn't come out until 2021
