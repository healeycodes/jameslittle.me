<h1>Reading Log</h1>

<p>In January of 2014, I started compiling a list of all the books I've read. 2014 marked the end of my junior year in high school, so the beginning of this list represents a lot of literature courses I took in hich school and college. I count listening to an audiobook as having read it, but my reading setup consists of Audible, my Kindle, and actual dead-tree books.</p>

<p>This explicitly <em>doesn't</em> track things I read onlineâ€”you might be interested in my <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:littleguy23">pinboard.in profile</a> for that.</p>

<p>This list contains {{count}} books, and is automatically generated from an Airtable base.</p>
