# Webpic

An application that preprocesses images into appropriately sized WebP, Progressive JPEG, or optimized PNG files for publishing online, then (optionally) uploads them to your S3 bucket and lets you quickly copy a `<picture>` tag for embedding in an HTML page.

Still in development. Try it out on Github: <https://github.com/jameslittle230/webpic>
